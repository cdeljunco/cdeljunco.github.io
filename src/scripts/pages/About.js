                I am a PhD candidate in the department of chemistry at the University of Chicago working with <a
                href="http://vaikuntanathan-group.uchicago.edu/" target="_blank">Suri Vaikuntanathan</a> (among other
                things; see <a href="#activities">Activities</a>). I use statistical mechanics to understand how energy
                consumption shapes the properties of non-equilibrium materials and processes, especially in biophysics.
                I am originally from Toronto, Canada. Before moving to Chicago I also lived in Montreal and the
                Netherlands. I speak English and French fluently, and some conversational Dutch. My last name is Spanish
                and is pronounced "del hoong-ko".
