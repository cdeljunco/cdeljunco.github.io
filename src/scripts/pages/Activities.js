                    Since 2016 I have been a departmental organizing and later a steward for the union of graduate
                    workers at the University of Chicago, <a href="http://www.uchicagogsu.org/" target="_blank">GSU</a>.
                    Most people would acknowledge that there is a detrimental power imbalance between
                    faculty/administrators and graduate students, that our departments (especially theoretical sciences)
                    are not diverse enough, that the days of a PhD guaranteeing a secure, well-paying job as a tenured
                    professor are long gone - yet few are willing to talk about the kind of systemic change that needs
                    to happen to address these issues. As I see it, unionizing is a way for graduate students to
                    leverage our position as workers who do teaching and research that is essential to the university's
                    mission in order to effect positive change in the university and surrounding communities. I will
                    stop there as many people have written more eloquently and at length on why grad students should
                    unionize[1], but I am always happy to discuss this if you see me.

                    Most recently, I was proud to take part in an industrial action with my colleagues where we <a
                        href="https://www.chicagomaroon.com/article/2019/6/4/gsu-strike-day-one/"
                        target="_blank">picketed</a> the University of Chicago for 3 days in June 2019 with broad
                    support from undergraduates, alumni, faculty, other labor unions, politicians, and community
                    members, in order to pressure the administration to meet their ethical obligation to recognize our
                    union.

                    In my capacity as an organizer, I have been invited to speak by grad workers at the University of
                    Chicago, Northwestern, and Stanford; organized events, facilitated meetings, and most importantly,
                    had hundreds of individual conversations with my peers.

                    In my limited remaining free time, I am a techno enthusiastic, aka raver. Mostly this interest does
                    not result in productive output, which is part of what I like about it, but in 2016 I contributed to
                    the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1H56d-XSiynLJ5BHaB8-UkzSKmLn67T0D/view"

                    Although the website you're on now was built by my friend and fellow techno enthusiast <a
                        href="https://www.hanna-jones.com/about" target="_blank">Hanna Jones</a>, I made the website and
                    was involved in developing the mission and first release of <a href="http://futureethics.net/"
                        target="_blank">Rave Ethics</a> offshoot label Future Ethics, run by <a
